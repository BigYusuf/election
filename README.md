<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Desktop Mode][product-screenshot]](https://rapidapi.com/BigYusuf/api/election3)

As always, All My projects are simple and unique. This one is no exception. I have been wanting to build this project for awhile now, especially when I was learning how to use react.js. I remember searching for an election API then and couldn't get one at the time. I picked Nigeria as country simply because, it is my country and the data is easy to use but its not so easy to get the complete election data.

Benefits of this API:

- The API is free, thereby granting unlimited access to Nigerian election data
- Easy integration to any application
- Easily accessible to the public through RapidAPI Hub.

For now, Only admin can login or register a user, the user endpoints isn't accessible to the general public for security reasons.
